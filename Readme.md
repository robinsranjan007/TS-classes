this file extensively covers the concepts of classes,

cheat sheet

1- Public classes can be initialized inside the classes and outside the classes by creating instance of this class or inside the extended classes or child classes
2- protected classes can be initialized inside the classes and inside the extended classes but cannot be initialized or change the value by creating the instance of the class
3- it can only be declared and initialized inside the classes;

4- super()-> invokes the constructor of the parent class or base class

5- in private method you cannot even access it outside the class
6- but in readonly you can access the member but cannot modify it

 7-If one of the properties in the Person class is marked as readonly, it means that it can only be assigned a value once either in the declaration or in the constructor of the class.
